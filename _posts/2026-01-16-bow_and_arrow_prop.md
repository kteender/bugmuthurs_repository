Original prop used in SEWER ISSUE. Original drawing, only one in existence. Comes with handwritten note about drawing's use in production (sneak peek: "Texas Switch") and the sketch drawing was based on. The arrowhead is the stamp of the city prefect, the fletching is Bugmuthur's icon, and the bow is the sewer.
